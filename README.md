# React Calculator

This is intended to be a clone of the google calculator. The application is built using the JavaScript library React JS. The application still has a few bugs when using scientific functions.

###### Features - mostly same as google calculator

- You can tap the right corner and view the history of your calculations.
- You can change between three different themes. I switch the feedback section to this.
- Scientific calculator included.
- Yoy can tap the inverse button to get more scientific functions.
- You can toggle between Radians and degrees.
- Help Section.

###### What I've learnt

- React life cycles.
- Diferences between state and props.
- Moving properties through the DOM tree other other components.
- Adding classes and css styles dynamically.
- Maintaining clean code by seprating UI components from logical components.

- using cross-fetch to fetch data from json-server (had to return to original code since github shouldn't be used for this reason)

###### What is let to be done

- Use redux to manage react state or context Api.
- Incorporate redux-thunk, redux-logger and middlerware in to react and redux.
- Test for bugs and fix.

## Installation
